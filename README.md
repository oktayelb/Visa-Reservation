Trying to pick a date for visa application was really frustrating so I tried to implement a simple solution for this using  Python Selenium.
The code itself only can go far enough to open the date picker, I haven't learned enough selenium to pick the closest date and check if its what you want.
You have to enter your credentials to the code, I haven't added a file based credential saving yet.
